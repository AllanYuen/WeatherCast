# WEATHERCAST PROJECT

## Description

The WeatherCast project is to showcase a MERN stack project in providing a weather lookup application that enables users to retrieve current weather conditions, 7-day forecasts, and historical weather data for specific locations. Users can search for weather information by entering a city name or postal code. They can also save their favorite locations for quick access to their weather information. The application provides notifications or alerts for severe weather conditions and allows users to switch between different units of measurement (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit). Additionally, users can access weather radar or satellite images for the selected location and set notifications for specific weather conditions such as rain, snow, or temperature thresholds. The application also provides access to weather-related news or articles.

While the idea of a weather app is not new, it enables our team to leverage on the learnings from MongoDB, Express.js, ReactJS, and Node.js to develop on this idea.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.

## User Stories

As a user of the WeatherCast application, I want to:
1. View the current weather conditions for a specific location.
2. See the temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the selected location.
3. Get a 7-day weather forecast for the selected location.
4. Search for weather information by entering a city name or postal code.
5. Save my favorite locations for quick access to their weather information.
6. Receive notifications or alerts for severe weather conditions.
7. Switch between different units of measurement (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit).
8. Access historical weather data for a specific location.
9. Enable location services to automatically fetch the weather information for my current location.
10. View weather radar or satellite images for the selected location.
11. Set notifications for specific weather conditions (e.g., rain, snow, temperature thresholds).
12. Access weather-related news or articles.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the weather lookup application,
    THEN they should see the current weather conditions for a specific location.

    THEN they should be able to view the temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the selected location.
3. WHEN a user opens the weather lookup application,
    THEN they should be able to get a 7-day weather forecast for the selected location.
4. WHEN a user opens the weather lookup application,
    THEN they should be able to search for weather information by entering a city name or zip code.
5. WHEN a user opens the weather lookup application,
    THEN they should be able to save their favorite locations for quick access to their weather information.
6. WHEN a user opens the weather lookup application,
    THEN they should receive notifications or alerts for severe weather conditions.
7. WHEN a user opens the weather lookup application,
    THEN they should be able to switch between different units of measurement (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit).
8. WHEN a user opens the weather lookup application,
     THEN they should be able to access historical weather data for a specific location.
9. WHEN a user opens the weather lookup application,
     THEN they should be able to enable location services to automatically fetch the weather information for their current location.
10. WHEN a user opens the weather lookup application,
     THEN they should be able to view weather radar or satellite images for the selected location.
11. WHEN a user opens the weather lookup application,
     THEN they should be able to set notifications for specific weather conditions (e.g., rain, snow, temperature thresholds).
12. WHEN a user opens the weather lookup application,
     THEN they should be able to access weather-related news or articles.
